- **Practical, reserved, and ruthlessly efficient** — Eduardo is the kind of Kindred who gets things done without fanfare.

- If someone begins the formal Ventrue chant, he cuts it short with a dry:  
  > “Ok, that’s enough…”

#### 🧬 Name & Origin

- Eduardo was born shortly after his family arrived in Brazil during the **WWII-era Polish migration**.
- His original Polish name was **Władysław**, but it was changed to **Eduardo** during registration — a common practice among immigrants whose names were deemed “too foreign” or difficult to pronounce.
- Despite the change, he remains quietly proud of his heritage and the legacy of the **Santa Cândida** community, founded by Polish migrants like his family.


#### 🧭 Influence & Role

- Oversees **Court logistics**, **boon records**, and **Kindred movement** across the domain.
- Has **final say** on who gets audience with the Prince — and who doesn’t.
- Keeps a **tight leash on the Lasombra probationers**, and is rumored to have blocked their access to certain Court functions.
- Rarely attends Elysium unless protocol demands it — and when he does, others tend to fall silent.

### Hook
 - Use “Władysław” as a name that only a few Kindred know (e.g., Nosferatu)
