## 🧪 Tremere in Curitiba — Post-Sabbat Collapse

### 🩸 Historical Context

- In the **early 2000s**, a **Sabbat assault** devastated the Tremere presence in Curitiba.
- The **chantry was destroyed**, and its two resident Tremere were lost:
  - **Magister Rafael** — killed during the defense of the chantry.
  - **Acolyte Helena Vilar** — missing, rumored to have been **impaled and kidnapped** by Sabbat war packs.
- Since then, **no Tremere have resided in Curitiba**, and the chantry has remained **sealed and abandoned**.
  - **No one outside the clan knows its exact location** — its entrance was hidden through layered wards and misdirection.
  - Some Kindred claim the ruins still **hum with residual magic**, while others believe Helena’s soul may be **bound to the site**.

### 🧛 Alessandra — Prince of São Paulo & Clan Steward

- A powerful Tremere who has ruled **São Paulo for over 30 years**.
- Has **no direct ties** to the Curitiba incident, but views the **loss of the chantry** as a strategic wound to the clan.
- Recently helped **reclaim the chantry in Brasília**, sending **Andre Diniz**, a survivor of the **Second Inquisition’s purge in Rio**, to rebuild it.
- Now considers doing the same for Curitiba — not for personal gain, but for **clan preservation** and **regional stability**.
- She’s **polling available Tremere**, but the **Vienna catastrophe** — the destruction of the clan’s global Pyramid HQ — has left **very few viable candidates**.
- May send a **young, untested Tremere** to reopen the lodge, knowing the risks involved.
- Her efforts may face **political resistance**, especially due to the presence of a **Banu Haqim Primogen** in Curitiba’s Court.

### 🕯️ Current Status

- The **chantry ruins** are monitored by **Nosferatu and Gangrel scouts**, but remain untouched.
- **Rumors** persist about Helena Vilar’s fate — some whisper she was diablerized, others believe she’s still alive, hidden or tormented.
- The **Curitiba Court** is divided on the return of the Tremere:
  - **Erick Weiss** distrusts their secrecy and magical influence.
  - **Camila Popadiuk** sees strategic value in their return, if properly managed.
  - The **Prince** has not spoken publicly, but is rumored to be **open to Alessandra’s proposal**.

  ### 🕯️ The Whisper of the Veil — A Hecata’s Secret

- **Unbeknownst to the Court**, a **Hecata** has recently sensed a **thinness in the Shroud** near an **abandoned bookstore** in Curitiba’s historic district.
- The sensation was subtle — like a whisper in the bones — but unmistakable: **something lingers there**, something old, buried, and magical.
- The Hecata has **told no one**, not even their clanmates. Instead, they quietly wonder:
  - **How could they investigate the site without drawing attention?**
  - **What knowledge or relics might lie beneath the dust and silence?**
  - **Could this be the lost Tremere chantry — or something even older?**
- For now, they watch. They wait. And they plan.
